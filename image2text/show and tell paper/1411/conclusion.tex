\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented NIC, an
end-to-end neural network system that can automatically view an image
and generate a reasonable description in plain English.
NIC is based on a convolution neural network that encodes an image into
a compact representation, followed by a recurrent neural network that
generates a corresponding sentence. The model is trained to maximize
the likelihood of the sentence given the image.
Experiments on several datasets
show the robustness of NIC in terms of qualitative results (the
generated sentences are very reasonable) and quantitative evaluations,
using either ranking metrics or BLEU, a metric used in machine translation
to evaluate the quality of generated sentences.
It is clear from these experiments that, as the size of the available
datasets for image description increases, so will the performance of
approaches like NIC.
Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how one can use unsupervised
data, both from images alone and text alone, to improve image description
approaches.
